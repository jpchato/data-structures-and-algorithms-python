## Solution
* Slice and print using index values

## Array Shift
* Takes an array and a value to be added to the array. The value should be added to the middle of the array.

## Approach and Efficiency
* I haven't solved it, yet. I think we have to take the length of the array, divide it by 2, and add 1. Then use that value as index value to insert the supplied integer to be added to the array

## Solution

## Array Binary Search
* Create a function with two parameters: a sorted list and a search key. Return the index of the search key or -1 if the search key is not in the sorted list.

## Approach and Efficiency
* I haven't solved it, yet.
