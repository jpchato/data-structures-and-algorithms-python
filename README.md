## Reverse Array
* Reverses an array without using built in methods of Python. Worked on this with Joseph Lee.

## Approach and Efficiency
* Take the input and reverse it using slice

## Solution
* Slice and print using index values

## Array Shift
* Takes an array and a value to be added to the array. The value should be added to the middle of the array.

## Approach and Efficiency
* I haven't solved it, yet. I think we have to take the length of the array, divide it by 2, and add 1. Then use that value as index value to insert the supplied integer to be added to the array

## Solution

## Array Binary Search
* Create a function with two parameters: a sorted list and a search key. Return the index of the search key or -1 if the search key is not in the sorted list.

## Approach and Efficiency
* I haven't solved it, yet.

## Solution

## Array Matrix
* Create a functionto add up the sum of each row in a matrix of arbitrary size and return an array with the appropriate values.

## Approach and Efficiency
* My approach is to loop through the main array and then loop through the row, summing the numbers as the function loops. After looping through the matrix, push the sums to a new array that then print out the appropriate values.

# Singly Linked List
## Challenge
* Create a linked list with various methods: insert, includes, and `__str__`.
## Approach and Efficiency
* I used various online resources and the class demo to stitch something together. It still needs work.
