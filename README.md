* Reverses an array without using built in methods of Python. Worked on this with Joseph Lee.

## Approach and Efficiency
* Take the input and reverse it using slice

## Solution
* Slice and print using index values

## Array Shift
* Takes an array and a value to be added to the array. The value should be added to the middle of the array.

## Approach and Efficiency
* I haven't solved it, yet. I think we have to take the length of the array, divide it by 2, and add 1. Then use that value as index value to insert the supplied integer to be added to the array

## Solution
* pending
